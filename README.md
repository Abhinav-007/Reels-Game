# Slot Machine game
Reels Game in javascript
This is a JavaScript program that simulates a slot machine game. Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

The program defines constants for the number of rows and columns in the slot machine grid, as well as the number 
of symbols of each type on the reels and their corresponding values.
The program defines several functions for different aspects of the game, including depositing money, selecting 
the number of lines to bet on, placing a bet, spinning the reels, transposing the reels to generate rows of symbols, 
printing the rows to the console, and calculating the winnings.
The program defines a main function called game() that runs the game loop. The loop begins by depositing an initial 
amount of money, then repeatedly prompts the user to place a bet and spin the reels. After each spin, the program 
calculates the winnings based on the symbols that appear on the rows and adds them to the player's balance. The loop 
ends when the player runs out of money or chooses to quit playing.
To run the program, the last line calls the game() function.
Overall, this program demonstrates basic JavaScript syntax and logic for implementing a simple game simulation.
